# Presentation Layer

This folder contains HTTP/WebSocket controllers, routes, and middleware. It should only interact with the application layer.

## Implementation Status

âœ… **Production Ready**: All underlying services now use real implementations:

- **RecallCompetitionService**: Real API integration with proper error handling
- **CogniverseService**: Real governance events from storage systems
- **GovernanceAgent**: Real asset discovery framework
- **FilecoinService**: Full Recall SDK integration
- **VersionManagementService**: Dynamic version management

All mock data fallbacks have been removed and replaced with production-ready implementations.

### Phase 4: Production Readiness ‚úÖ

- **Security Hardening:** Smart contract audits and security reviews
- **Performance Optimization:** Efficient data storage and retrieval patterns
- **Documentation:** Complete API documentation and user guides
- **Demo Preparation:** Polished demo for hackathon submission

## üöÄ Demo Setup

### Quick Start

1. **Clone and Install**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd cognivern
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure Environment**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your Filecoin wallet and API keys
   # Contracts are already deployed - addresses included in .env.example
   ```

3. **Verify Contract Deployment** (Optional - contracts already deployed)

   ```bash
   # Contracts are already deployed and working:
   # GovernanceContract: 0x8FBF38c4b64CABb76AA24C40C02d0a4b10173880
   # AIGovernanceStorage: 0x0Ffe56a0A202d88911e7f67dC7336fb14678Dada
   # USDFC Token: 0x7b79995e5f793A07Bc00c21412e50Ecae098E7f9

   # To deploy new contracts (if needed):
   pnpm run deploy-contracts
   ```

4. **Start the Platform**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Access the Demo**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - API: http://localhost:3000/api

### Demo Features

1. **On-Chain Governance**

# Cognivern Agent System

## Overview

Cognivern provides a comprehensive framework for AI agent governance, enabling transparent, verifiable, and trustless operation through on-chain policy enforcement and immutable audit trails.

## Agent Capabilities

- **Policy-Enforced Behavior**: All agent actions are validated against defined governance policies
- **Immutable Decision Logs**: Complete chain-of-thought reasoning stored permanently on Filecoin
- **Verifiable Actions**: Cryptographically signed decisions with full provenance tracking
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live governance metrics and compliance tracking
- **Cross-Agent Intelligence**: Structured knowledge exchange between governed agents

## Agent Structure

### Core Components

- **PolicyEnforcementService**: Ensures agent actions comply with defined policies
- **AuditLogService**: Records all agent decisions with full reasoning chains
- **MetricsService**: Tracks performance metrics and resource usage

### Chain-of-Thought Data Format

```json
{
  "agentId": "agent-1",
  "timestamp": "2025-03-31T12:00:00Z",
  "input": "User requested financial analysis of Company X",
  "reasoning": [
    {
      "step": 1,
      "thought": "I need to gather recent financial data for Company X",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "sources": ["financial-database-1"]
    }
  ],
  "decision": "Recommend caution on Company X investment due to overvaluation concerns",
  "signature": "0x7f9e...b6c5d4e3f2a1b0",
  "metadata": {
    "modelVersion": "GPT-5-turbo",
    "governancePolicy": "financial-advisory-v2",
    "complianceStatus": "compliant"
  }
}
```

## Integration Examples

### Monitor an Agent

```typescript
import { GovernanceMonitor } from "cognivern";

const monitor = new GovernanceMonitor({
  agentId: "financial-advisor-1",
  policyName: "financial-advisory",
  recallBucket: "0xff0000000000000000000000000000000000fba1",
});

monitor.attach(myExistingAgent);
await monitor.startMonitoring();
```

## Security Features

- âœ… All agent actions are validated against defined policies
- âœ… Policy enforcement happens in real-time before actions are executed
- âœ… Comprehensive audit logging for compliance and debugging
- âœ… Rate limiting and resource monitoring to prevent abuse
- âœ… Secure storage of sensitive data in Recall buckets

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: MVP (Current) âœ…

- âœ… Basic agent monitoring and logging with Recall integration
- âœ… Chain-of-Thought (CoT) logging with cryptographic signatures
- âœ… Policy-based governance controls
- âœ… Real-time WebSocket updates
- âœ… Essential security features with API key authentication

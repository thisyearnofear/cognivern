### 🤖 Agent Architecture

```typescript
class DirectTradingAgent {
  // Trading Configuration
  private readonly DAILY_TRADE_TARGET = 6; // Every 4 hours
  private readonly MIN_TRADE_INTERVAL = 4 * 60 * 60 * 1000;

  // Token Portfolio
  private readonly TOKENS = {
    USDC: "EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v",
    SOL: "So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112",
    ETH: "7vfCXTUXx5WJV5JADk17DUJ4ksgau7utNKj4b963voxs",
    BTC: "9n4nbM75f5Ui33ZbPYXn59EwSgE8CGsHtAeTH5YFeJ9E",
  };

  // Autonomous execution with governance oversight
  async executeNextTrade(): Promise<void> {
    // 1. Check governance policies
    // 2. Analyze market conditions
    // 3. Execute trade via Recall API
    // 4. Log decision to audit trail
  }
}
```

### 📈 Trading Strategies

The agent employs 6 distinct trading strategies that rotate throughout the day:

1. **Momentum Trading**: USDC → SOL based on market analysis
2. **Portfolio Diversification**: SOL → ETH for cross-asset exposure
3. **Crypto Rotation**: ETH → BTC based on relative strength
4. **Profit Taking**: BTC → USDC to secure gains
5. **Re-entry Strategy**: USDC → SOL on dip opportunities
6. **Risk Management**: SOL → USDC to reduce exposure

## Integration Methods

### 1. SDK Integration (Recommended)

```typescript
import { CogniverseGovernanceSDK } from "@cognivern/sdk";

const governance = new CogniverseGovernanceSDK({
  agentId: "your-agent-id",
  policyId: "your-policy-id",
  filecoinPrivateKey: process.env.FILECOIN_PRIVATE_KEY,
  recallBucketAddress: process.env.RECALL_BUCKET_ADDRESS,
});

// Before making any decision
const decision = await myAgent.generateDecision(input);
const approved = await governance.checkPolicy(decision);

if (approved) {
  const result = await myAgent.executeDecision(decision);
  await governance.logDecision(decision, result);
} else {
  await governance.logViolation(decision, "Policy violation detected");
}
```

### 2. API Integration

```bash
# Register your agent
curl -X POST "https://api.cognivern.com/agents" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "name": "My AI Agent",
    "description": "Content moderation agent for social media",
    "domain": "content_moderation",
    "capabilities": ["text_analysis", "image_recognition"]
  }'

# Check policy compliance
curl -X POST "https://api.cognivern.com/policies/check" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "agentId": "agent-123",
    "decision": {
      "action": "moderate_content",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "Content violates community guidelines"
    }
  }'
```

### 3. Webhook Integration

```typescript
// Your agent sends decisions to Cognivern
const webhookUrl = "https://api.cognivern.com/webhooks/decisions";

await fetch(webhookUrl, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${API_KEY}`,
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    agentId: "your-agent-id",
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    decision: {
      type: "content_moderation",
      action: "approve",
      confidence: 0.87,
      reasoning: "Content meets community standards",
      metadata: { contentId: "post-123", userId: "user-456" },
    },
  }),
});
```

## AI-Assisted Policy Creation

### Natural Language Policy Generation

Users describe their agent's behavior and requirements in plain English:

```
"My trading agent should:
- Never risk more than 5% of portfolio on a single trade
- Stop trading if daily losses exceed 2%
- Only trade during market hours (9 AM - 4 PM EST)
- Require human approval for trades over $10,000
- Maintain a minimum cash reserve of 20%"
```

The platform uses AI (GPT-4/Gemini) to generate formal policies:

```typescript
interface GeneratedPolicy {
  rules: [
    {
      id: "max_position_risk";
      type: "rate_limit";
      condition: "trade.amount > portfolio.value * 0.05";
      action: { type: "block"; message: "Position size exceeds 5% limit" };
    },
    {
      id: "daily_loss_limit";
      type: "rate_limit";
      condition: "daily_loss > portfolio.value * 0.02";
      action: { type: "throttle"; duration: "24h" };
    },
    // ... more rules
  ];
  metadata: {
    domain: "trading";
    riskLevel: "conservative";
    complianceFramework: "financial_services";
  };
}
```

### Policy Recommendation Engine

Based on agent domain and description, the platform suggests:

- **Industry Best Practices**: Standard policies for the domain.
- **Risk Management**: Appropriate safeguards and limits.
- **Compliance Requirements**: Regulatory considerations.
- **Performance Optimization**: Policies that improve agent effectiveness.

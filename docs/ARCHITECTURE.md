# Architecture

## Mission

**Make agent wallet activity governable.**

Cognivern is a control plane for OWS wallets that handles policy checks, approvals, and audit for autonomous agents.

## Responsibility Boundary

| OWS Owns                   | Cognivern Owns                     | Swappable Via              |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Wallet storage             | Policy evaluation                  | —                          |
| API-key issuance           | Approval workflows                 | —                          |
| Transaction signing        | Audit-log indexing / signing layer | SigningProvider adapter    |
| Signing policy enforcement | Run ledger & analytics             | —                          |

The signing layer is abstracted behind a `SigningProvider` interface. The default provider uses the local OWS vault (`OwsLocalVaultService`). Alternative providers — **Ledger DMK** (hardware signing for high-value transactions) and **Speculos** (emulated signing for sandbox/CI) — slot in without changing the governance or audit path. See [Signing Provider Abstraction](#signing-provider-abstraction).

```

## Canonical Decision Lifecycle

Every governance decision follows this path through the codebase:

```
Agent action
  → GovernanceController.evaluateAction()
  → PolicyEnforcementService.evaluateRule()
      ├─ standard rule → local evaluation (allow/deny/require/rate_limit)
      ├─ confidential rule → FhenixPolicyService → Fhenix FHE
      └─ contract_audit rule → ChainGPTAuditService
  → decision: approve / hold / deny
  → [on approve] SigningProvider.dispatch(wallet.metadata.signingProvider)
      ├─ "local"     → OwsLocalVaultService.signMessage()
      ├─ "ledger"    → LedgerSigningProvider.sign()  ← DMK, device must confirm
      ├─ "speculos"  → OwsLocalVaultService.signWithExternalWallet(Speculos HTTP API)
      └─ "ows_remote"→ OwsLocalVaultService.signWithExternalWallet(remote URL)
  → AuditLogService.logAction()
  → [optional] Filecoin evidence signing via CRE evidence pipeline (FILECOIN_PRIVATE_KEY)
  → [optional] 0G Storage evidence anchoring via ZeroGStorageService (dual-anchor with Filecoin)
  → [optional] X Layer execution dispatch via Hyperlane Mailbox (contract-side)
```

This is the actual code path — not an aspirational design. It is implemented across:

- **`src/backend/modules/api/controllers/GovernanceController.ts`** — HTTP entry point, resolves active policy, calls enforcement
- **`src/backend/services/PolicyEnforcementService.ts`** — Evaluates rules one-by-one, delegates confidential rules to Fhenix, delegates contract audit to ChainGPT
- **`src/backend/services/AuditLogService.ts`** — Persists every decision as a CRE-backed evidence record
- **`src/backend/services/FhenixPolicyService.ts`** — Encrypted policy evaluation using CoFHE SDK
- **`src/backend/services/ChainGPTAuditService.ts`** — Runtime smart contract vulnerability scanning

## Existing Building Blocks

### 1. Ingestion — `POST /ingest/runs`

Project-scoped run submission with ingest key validation, quota metering, and normalized run capture for downstream UI.

### 2. Governance Evaluation

`GovernanceController` exposes policy CRUD and evaluation:

- `GET/POST /api/governance/policies`
- `POST /api/governance/evaluate`

`PolicyEnforcementService` loads the active policy and evaluates actions rule by rule, returning structured allow/deny decisions with per-rule checks.

### 3. Audit & Run Ledger

`AuditLogService` converts actions and events into CRE-backed evidence records.

`CreController` exposes run lists, details, event streams, retries, approvals, and plan updates.

### 4. OWS Wallet Layer

`OwsLocalVaultService` stores encrypted local wallets, issues delegated API keys, and resolves wallet access for spend execution.

`OwsWalletService` exposes `/api/spend`, enforces spend policies, produces approve/hold/deny outcomes, signs approved spend envelopes, and persists runs to the CRE ledger.

### 5. Signing Provider Abstraction

The signing layer is swappable via a `SigningProvider` interface. The dispatch happens in `OwsWalletService.handleApprove()` based on `wallet.metadata.signingProvider`:

| Provider | Value | Backend | Use Case |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Local** | `"local"` (default) | `OwsLocalVaultService.signMessage()` — decrypted local key | Development, low-value, personal agents |
| **OWS Remote** | `"ows_remote"` | `OwsLocalVaultService.signWithExternalWallet()` — HTTP POST to remote signing service | Multi-instance deployments |
| **Ledger DMK** | `"ledger"` | `LedgerSigningProvider` — `@ledgerhq/device-management-kit` via USB/WebHID | Production high-value transactions, hardware-gated |
| **Speculos** | `"speculos"` | `OwsLocalVaultService.signWithExternalWallet()` — HTTP POST to Speculos API | Sandbox/CI, no hardware needed |

The backend wallet descriptor (`OwsWalletDescriptor.metadata`) carries the provider selection:

```typescript
// Local wallet (existing)
{ metadata: {} }

// Ledger hardware wallet
{ metadata: { signingProvider: "ledger" } }

// Speculos emulated wallet (sandbox)
{ metadata: { signingProvider: "speculos", externalSource: "http://speculos:5000" } }
```

**Sandbox integration:** Speculos runs as a Docker container alongside the backend. In sandbox mode (controlled by `demoInterceptor.ts`), wallets are created with `signingProvider: "speculos"` and `externalSource` pointing at the Speculos HTTP API. The existing `signWithExternalWallet()` method handles the HTTP transport — zero new code for the basic case. This lets CI run full governance→signing→audit cycles with hardware-accurate signing but zero asset risk.

**Production Ledger flow:** An agent requests a high-value spend → policy evaluates and approves → `handleApprove()` dispatches to `LedgerSigningProvider` → DMK discovers the device → user confirms on physical Ledger → signature returned → audit-logged as before. The governance and audit pipeline never changes — only the signing step swaps.

### 6. Frontend Control Plane

The frontend contains surfaces for policy management, audit logs, run ledger, agent monitoring, governance checks, and the Command Center terminal UI.

### 7. Copilot Mission Console

`CopilotController` drives the live demo flow exposed at `/copilot`. A user submits a natural-language spend goal, the agent runs it through the full lifecycle, and the operator confirms or denies at the human gate.

- `POST /api/copilot/runs` — start a new mission (returns 202 + the run with a SSE event stream id)
- `GET /api/copilot/runs` — list recent runs, newest first, for the history rail (query: `?limit=N`, default 10, max 50)
- `GET /api/copilot/runs/:runId` — full run + events (used by replay mode)
- `POST /api/copilot/runs/:runId/confirm` — operator decision (`{ approve, reason }`); appends `confirmation_recorded` and `execution_blocked` events
- `GET /api/copilot/runs/:runId/events/stream` — SSE event stream (cursor-based, heartbeats every 750ms)

Runs are persisted to SQLite via `CopilotRunStore` so they survive pm2 restarts and lean deploys. The in-memory `Map` that previously held them is gone. SSE reads from the same store, so the stream stays consistent with what the operator sees on the page.

The frontend mirrors this with three UX surfaces: the run button + phase strip + live trace while a mission is active, a recent-decisions rail that lets the user replay or re-run prior missions, and a post-decision card that nudges toward history review, re-run, or policy tuning.

## Network Roles

Each partner network plays a specific role in the product. This table is the single source of truth — all other docs and UI descriptions reference it.

| Partner | Role in product | User-visible? | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Fhenix** | Confidential policy evaluation via FHE. Budgets, limits, and spend counters remain encrypted throughout evaluation. | Yes — FHE shield badge on audit decisions | **Live** (Fhenix testnet: Arbitrum Sepolia / Base Sepolia) |
| **X Layer** | Governed execution dispatch path. After policy evaluation, approved spends are dispatched here for execution and public anchoring. | Yes — in decision audit trail via Hyperlane | Testnet (chainId 1952) |
| **Filecoin** | Durable evidence anchoring for audit logs. Long-term immutable storage of governance decisions and evidence hashes. | Yes — evidence link per decision in audit entry | Calibration testnet |
| **0G** | Real-time governance decision anchoring alongside Filecoin. Stores `zeroGRootHash` in `CreRun.evidence` for dual-anchor integrity. | Transparently layered with Filecoin | **Live** — via `ZeroGStorageService` (0G Newton testnet) |
| **ChainGPT** | Web3-specialized LLM for smart contract auditing at runtime (pre-spend vulnerability scan) and governance-copilot queries. | Yes — Contract Audit badge on policy checks with ChainGPT metadata | **Live** — via `ChainGPTAuditService` |
| **Speculos** | Ledger device emulator for sandbox/CI signing. Runs as a Docker container; acts as an HTTP signing endpoint for the existing `signWithExternalWallet()` path. | No — infra only | **Live** — Docker Compose sandbox profile |
| **Ledger DMK** | Hardware signing provider for high-value transactions. User confirms on physical Ledger device before any signature is produced. | Yes — "Hardware Signed" badge on audit decisions | **Live** — `LedgerSigningProvider` (DMK) |
| **MongoDB** | Persistent agent memory & run ledger. Replaces JSONL files with queryable, durable storage. | Yes — powers agent recall and run history | **Live** — optional, gated by `MONGODB_URI` |

## Confidential Policy Layer (Fhenix)

Confidential policy evaluation uses Fully Homomorphic Encryption on Fhenix (CoFHE):

- **`ConfidentialSpendPolicy.sol`** on Fhenix holds encrypted budgets (`euint128`), encrypted spend counters, and encrypted approval thresholds.
- **`FhenixPolicyService.ts`** wraps `@cofhe/sdk` to evaluate encrypted amounts, submit to Fhenix, and unseal data for auditors.
- **Cross-chain flow (via Hyperlane):** Fhenix emits a decision attestation → Hyperlane Mailbox dispatches it → X Layer `GovernanceContract.handle()` consumes it for execution and public anchoring.
- **Encrypted state never leaves Fhenix:** Only the verified outcome (Approved/Denied/Held) crosses chains.
- **Selective disclosure:** Auditor permits issued via the dashboard allow scoped decryption of confidential audit logs.

Policies opt in via a `confidential: true` flag in their metadata.

See [Fhenix Integration](./FHENIX_INTEGRATION.md) for full details.

## Mode System

Cognivern operates in three distinct modes:

| Mode | Auth Required | Data Source | UI Indicator |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Demo** | No | Client-side demo data (`demo-data.ts`) + backend `DemoDataService` | Amber "Demo Mode" badge in sidebar |
| **Sandbox** | Yes (wallet or email) | Backend `WorkspaceDataService` (canned/test data) with `X-Workspace-Mode: sandbox` header | Sandbox/Production toggle in workspace switcher |
| **Production** | Yes (wallet or email) | Backend `WorkspaceDataService` (live SQLite) | "Live Workspace" green banner |

**Mode resolution (single source of truth in `demoInterceptor.ts`):**

1. Workspace `tier` is stored in SQLite — `'demo'` or `'live'`
2. If `tier === 'demo'`, the backend always serves demo data regardless of the `X-Workspace-Mode` header
3. If `tier === 'live'`, the `X-Workspace-Mode` header (`sandbox` | `production`) selects the data source
4. Self-service upgrade from `demo` to `live` is available in Settings → Workspace → "Go Live"

**Frontend mode store (`demo-store.ts`):**
- `useDemoStore` controls the demo flag independently of auth state
- `login()` automatically exits demo mode
- The `DemoBanner` component shows workspace status in the header

## Storage Architecture

File-backed stores are built on a common `BaseStore` abstract class that provides:

- Lazy file loading (JSON/JSONL)
- TTL-based expiration
- Max-record limits
- Atomic read/write operations

| Store | File | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `RateLimitStore` | `rate-limit-store.jsonl` | Per-workspace and per-key rate limiting with sliding windows |
| `TokenBlacklistStore` | `token-blacklist.jsonl` | JWT token revocation blacklist |
| `UxEventStore` | `ux-events.jsonl` | UX telemetry events |
| `CreRunStore` | `cre-runs.jsonl` (+ MongoDB optional) | Core Run Engine evidence ledger (via `CreRunPersistence` interface). Conditionally writes to MongoDB when `MONGODB_URI` is set |
| `IdempotencyStore` | file-backed with TTL | Idempotency key tracking |
| `CopilotRunStore` | SQLite (`copilot_runs` + `copilot_events`) | Live demo mission runs + their event streams. Replaces the previous in-memory `Map` that lost runs on every pm2 restart. Reads and writes are synchronous via `better-sqlite3` prepared statements; the SSE poller reads from the same tables so the stream is always consistent with `getRun`. |

The `BaseStore<T, R>` interface accepts a config for file path (via env var or default), max records, and TTL. Subclasses override `parseLine()` and `serializeRecord()`.

To swap to Redis, Postgres, or MongoDB: implement the same interface on a new adapter and replace the singleton import — no callers change.

**SQLite-backed services:**

| Service | File | Tables | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CopilotRunStore` | `src/backend/modules/api/storage/CopilotRunStore.ts` | `copilot_runs`, `copilot_events` | Live demo mission runs + their event streams |

`copilot_runs` holds one row per mission (`id`, `goal`, `status`, `summary`, `error`, `preview`, `result`, `created_at`, `updated_at`); `copilot_events` holds the event log keyed by `(run_id, id)`. Both tables are created idempotently by the migration in `src/backend/db/index.ts` on first boot, so a cold deploy or fresh checkout works without a manual migration step. To scope runs per workspace later, add a nullable `workspace_id` column to `copilot_runs` and gate `listRecent` on `req.workspaceId`.

**MongoDB-backed services:**

| Service | File | Collection | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `MongoDbCreRunPersistence` | `src/backend/cre/storage/MongoDbCreRunPersistence.ts` | `cre_runs` | Durable run ledger alongside JSONL hot cache |
| `MongoDbMemoryService` | `src/backend/services/MongoDbMemoryService.ts` | `agent_memory` | Cross-session agent memory (store, retrieve, query by agentId/type) |

Both are lazy-connected and gracefully degrade when `MONGODB_URI` is unset — zero config required for existing JSONL-only users.

## Async FHE Evaluation (Live)

Fhenix FHE evaluations can take 10-30 seconds (CoFHE encryption + on-chain confirmation). The async UX is now implemented:

1. Backend checks `policy.metadata.confidential === true` on evaluate
2. Returns `202 Accepted` with `{ runId, status: "running", type: "fhe_evaluation" }`
3. Background workflow (`src/backend/cre/workflows/governance.ts`) tracks progress via `CreRunRecorder` with 4 steps:
   - `load_policy` — load the active policy
   - `encrypt_params` — encrypt spend parameters via CoFHE SDK
   - `submit_to_fhenix` — submit to Fhenix contract and wait for on-chain confirmation
   - `record_audit` — persist the decision to the audit log
4. Each step is persisted to `CreRunStore` as it completes, so the existing SSE endpoint (`GET /api/cre/runs/:runId/events/stream`) streams live progress
5. Frontend connects to SSE via `fetch` + `ReadableStream` (not native `EventSource`, which lacks auth header support) and shows an animated 4-step progress panel
6. When `run_finished` arrives with the result payload, the UI transitions to the decision panel
7. `GET /api/governance/evaluate/:runId/result` provides a fallback to fetch the completed result
8. Standard (non-confidential) evaluations remain synchronous via the existing path

**Implementation files:**
- `src/backend/cre/workflows/governance.ts` — background evaluation with CreRunRecorder
- `src/backend/modules/api/controllers/GovernanceController.ts` — 202 dispatch for confidential policies
- `src/frontend/src/hooks/use-fhe-progress.ts` — shared React hook for step tracking and SSE connection
- `src/frontend/src/components/governance/governance-check.tsx` — full-page governance check with FHE progress panel
- `src/frontend/src/components/onboarding/onboarding-wizard.tsx` — compact inline governance check with same FHE support

## Persistence Layer

### PolicyPersistence

Policies are persisted through a `PolicyPersistence` interface (analogous to `CreRunPersistence`):

| Implementation | Location | Storage |
|----------------|----------|---------|
| `InMemoryPolicyPersistence` | `src/backend/persistence/PolicyPersistence.ts` | In-memory `Map` (default) |
| `MongoDbPolicyPersistence` | `src/backend/persistence/MongoDbPolicyPersistence.ts` | MongoDB `policies` collection |

`PolicyService` delegates all CRUD to the injected backend, selected conditionally at startup:
- Default → `InMemoryPolicyPersistence` (same behavior as before)
- `MONGODB_URI` set → `MongoDbPolicyPersistence`

Bundled `.json` policies (from `src/backend/policies/`) are seeded on init with duplicate-ID skip. See `src/backend/persistence/PolicyPersistence.ts`.

## Cross-Cutting Refactors

### Logging Consolidation

Two logging systems existed: `src/backend/utils/logger.ts` (default export, 32 importers) and `src/backend/shared/logging/Logger.ts` (class + facade, 18 importers). They were consolidated by making `utils/logger.ts` re-export from the shared `Logger.ts` facade. All 32 importers continue to work unchanged; the shared `Logger` class had its `LogContext` type loosened to `any` to match winston's native flexibility.

### Circuit Breaker Consolidation

Three circuit breaker implementations were consolidated into one:

| Old Implementation | Location | Disposition |
|-------------------|----------|-------------|
| Standalone `CircuitBreaker` class | `src/backend/shared/utils/circuitBreaker.ts` | **Kept** — canonical implementation |
| `BaseService.withCircuitBreaker()` | `src/backend/shared/services/BaseService.ts` | **Removed** — 104 lines, no subclass called it |
| Inline breaker in `IntentController` | `src/backend/modules/api/controllers/IntentController.ts` | **Refactored** — now uses the standalone `CircuitBreaker` class |

The single `CircuitBreaker` class was extended with public `recordFailure()`/`reset()` methods to support the explicit-failure-recording pattern used by `IntentController`.

## Current Limitations

- File-backed stores (rate limiting, idempotency, telemetry) are single-instance — need Redis/Postgres before horizontal scaling. The `BaseStore` interface exists to make this a single-adapter swap.
- Email auth is supported alongside SIWE (wallet-primary); the SIWE path is more battle-tested in production.
- **Ledger signing requires USB/WebHID access**, which limits deployment to single-instance or co-located with the hardware. The Speculos sandbox path avoids this in testing.
- See the [Deployment Guide](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for operations

## Security Architecture

The product implements layered security:

| Layer | Protection |
|---|---|
| Auth | SIWE + JWT with nonce replay protection |
| API Keys | scrypt hashed, workspace-scoped permissions |
| Rate Limiting | 3 layers (global, workspace, per-endpoint) |
| Encryption | Fhenix FHE on-chain evaluation (confidential policies) |
| Audit | Immutable records on Filecoin / 0G |
| Contract Audit | ChainGPT runtime scan on recipient contracts |

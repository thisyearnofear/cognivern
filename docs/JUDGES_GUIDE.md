# Chainlink Convergence Hackathon: Judges Guide

Welcome to the Cognivern evaluation guide. This document provides direct evidence of a **production-grade AI prediction agent powered by Chainlink CRE**.

## 🎯 Submission Summary

Cognivern is a **decentralized AI forecasting agent** that uses CRE workflows to orchestrate prediction market analysis with consensus-verified data fetching, confidential LLM reasoning, and on-chain attestation — eliminating single points of failure at every step of the pipeline.

**Track**: AI Agents (DeFi & Web3 / Multi-agent & orchestration)

## 📍 Evidence 1: Meaningful CRE Usage

Cognivern uses **five CRE capabilities** in a single forecasting workflow:

| CRE Capability | What It Does in Cognivern |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Cron Trigger** | Schedules the forecasting pipeline every 10 minutes |
| **HTTP Fetch** | Fetches Sapience prediction market data with DON consensus |
| **Confidential HTTP** | Calls LLM APIs privately — reasoning stays in enclave until attested |
| **EVM Read** | Reads Chainlink Data Feeds (price data) as forecasting inputs |
| **EVM Write** | Submits EAS attestations to Arbitrum with multi-node verification |

**Why CRE matters here**: A prediction market agent that fetches data from a single endpoint and submits via a single RPC is vulnerable to manipulation. CRE ensures every step is independently verified by multiple DON nodes.

## 📍 Evidence 2: Live On-Chain Activity

Cognivern has existing on-chain attestations from prior production operation:

- **Agent Wallet:** `0xc8F0D4FF31166Daf37804C20eeFd059e041E64dC`
- **Arbiscan:** [View EAS Attestations](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xc8F0D4FF31166Daf37804C20eeFd059e041E64dC)
- **Proof of Accuracy:** Horizon-Weighted Strategy prioritizes markets with the furthest resolution date.

## 📍 Evidence 3: Confidential AI Reasoning

Cognivern's key innovation is **private LLM reasoning via Confidential HTTP**:

- The agent's prediction logic cannot be front-run because LLM calls execute within CRE's confidential enclaves
- API keys (Routeway.ai, Groq) are injected via CRE Secrets — never exposed to the DON
- Only the final probability output leaves the enclave and gets attested on-chain

## 📍 Evidence 4: Real-Time Dashboard

The Cognivern dashboard shows the agent's reasoning in real-time:
- **What to look for:** The Activity Feed shows live forecasts with the reasoning text generated by the Multi-LLM layer
- **Multi-LLM Resilience:** Primary (Routeway.ai Kimi K2) with automatic failover to Groq (Llama 3.3 70B)

## 🛠️ Technical Differentiators

### 1. End-to-End Decentralization via CRE
Every step of the prediction pipeline — data fetching, price reading, LLM reasoning, attestation submission — runs across a DON with BFT consensus. No single point of failure.

### 2. Chainlink Data Feeds as Forecasting Inputs
The agent reads ETH/USD and BTC/USD price feeds via EVM Read capability, using real-time on-chain price data to inform its probability estimates.

### 3. Multi-LLM Orchestration
A custom failover layer within the CRE callback ensures 100% uptime: if Routeway.ai (Kimi K2) is throttled, the agent falls back to Groq (Llama 3.3) — all within a single CRE execution.

### 4. Horizon-Weighted Market Selection
The agent doesn't pick random markets. It calculates time-until-resolution for each market and prioritizes those with the longest horizon, mathematically optimizing for accuracy scoring.

## Judging Criteria Alignment

| Criteria | Evidence |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Technical Execution** | Production-grade agent with Multi-LLM resilience, governance guardrails, and live on-chain history |
| **Effective Use of CRE** | 5 capabilities used meaningfully (cron, HTTP, confidential HTTP, EVM read, EVM write) |
| **Blockchain Technology** | EAS attestations on Arbitrum, Chainlink Data Feed consumption, consensus-verified writes |
| **Originality (Wow Factor)** | First prediction market agent with confidential AI reasoning via CRE — predictions can't be front-run |

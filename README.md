# Cognivern: The Agent Governance Command Center

Cognivern is the mission control for your autonomous agents.

It provides a high-fidelity environment for tracking, auditing, and governing agent ecosystems. By combining **decentralized evidence storage**, **high-performance coordination**, and **confidential compute**, Cognivern ensures that agent autonomy is always backed by accountability and transparency.

**Wedge:** Don’t change how your agents run — just *connect them* to Cognivern for professional-grade observability and governance.

## 🌟 Vision: Trusted Agentic Systems

Cognivern empowers developers to build and operate agents with confidence by leveraging a robust multi-chain foundation:

- **Observability & Proof:** Every decision, reasoning step, and artifact is captured in a verifiable forensic timeline.
- **Behavioral Governance:** Enforce real-time policies and safety guardrails across your entire agent network.
- **Spatial Intelligence:** Visualize your agent ecosystem in a high-fidelity command center designed for the agentic era.
- **Multi-Chain Integrity:**
    - **Verifiable Evidence (Filecoin):** Permanent, tamper-proof storage for forensic audit trails.
    - **High-Performance Coordination (Polkadot):** Low-latency governance and cross-chain orchestration.
    - **Confidential Compute (Chainlink):** Secure, private reasoning in decentralized enclaves.

## What it does (today)

- **Unified Dashboard**: Ecosystem-wide overview with spatial visualization and performance telemetry.
- **Behavioral Analytics**: Tracking "Policy Compliance Score," "Autonomy Level," and "Risk Profile."
- **Audit Logs & AI Insights**: Human-readable governance summaries powered by Gemini.
- **Forensic Detail**: Deep-dive into an agent's "Thoughts" with cognitive path reconstruction.
- **Policy Engine**: Modular governance guards with visual risk ratings.

## Who it’s for

- Teams running agents in production who need **debugging, governance, and accountability**.
- Builders shipping on-chain automation who need **proof** for high-stakes actions.

## Key idea

Agents are cheap. **Trust and reliability are expensive.**

Cognivern is the layer that turns “agent runs” into something you can operate, audit, and bill.

## Evidence of Reliability

Cognivern is built on production-grade infrastructure with a proven track record:
- **Verified Attestations:** [View Agent Wallet & Audit History](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xc8F0D4FF31166Daf37804C20eeFd059e041E64dC)
- **Real-Time Reasoning:** Live "Thoughts" feed generated by multi-LLM resilience layers.
- **On-Chain Governance:** Active policy enforcement on multi-chain testnets.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v20.14+
- pnpm
- Arbitrum ETH for gas fees (Address: `0xc8F0D4FF31166Daf37804C20eeFd059e041E64dC`)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thisyearnofear/cognivern.git
cd cognivern
pnpm install
```

### Configuration

Cognivern enforces a strict **"No Mocks"** policy. Features only activate when valid production keys are present.

Create `.env` file:

```env
# Sapience / Polkadot Hub (REQUIRED)
POLKADOT_RPC_URL=https://polkadot-hub-rpc.url
POLKADOT_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here

# Sapience / Arbitrum (OPTIONAL)
ARBITRUM_RPC_URL=https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc
SAPIENCE_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here

# Resilient LLM Layer (REQUIRED)
ROUTEWAY_API_KEY=your_routeway_key
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_key

# Recall Network (REQUIRED for Memory)
RECALL_API_KEY=your_recall_key
RECALL_BUCKET=agent-memory

# Filecoin FVM (REQUIRED for Governance)
FILECOIN_RPC_URL=https://api.calibration.node.glif.io/rpc/v1
FILECOIN_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
GOVERNANCE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x...
```

### Run the backend

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

### Ingest a run from any agent

```bash
# Configure projects/keys
export COGNIVERN_PROJECTS="default:Default Project"
export COGNIVERN_INGEST_KEYS="default=dev-ingest-key"

# Send a run
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/ingest/runs \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer dev-ingest-key' \
  -H 'X-PROJECT-ID: default' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"runId":"123","projectId":"default","workflow":"forecasting","mode":"local","startedAt":"2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","finishedAt":"2026-01-01T00:00:01.000Z","ok":true,"steps":[],"artifacts":[]}'
```

Or use the included example:
```bash
pnpm ingest-example
```

## Deployment

See [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](./docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for the standard artifact-based release process (build locally, deploy to Hetzner, rollback via symlink).

### Multi-LLM Resilience Layer
1. **Tier 1 (Routeway.ai):** High-context reasoning using Moonshot Kimi K2 via Confidential HTTP.
2. **Tier 2 (Groq):** Ultra-fast failover using Llama 3.3 (70B) if Tier 1 is throttled or offline.

Both LLM calls execute within CRE's Confidential HTTP capability — API keys and reasoning remain private within enclave execution.

## Technical Foundation

Cognivern is a multi-chain platform that leverages the strengths of the Web3 ecosystem:
- **Chainlink CRE:** Decentralized compute and confidential LLM reasoning.
- **Filecoin (FVM):** Verifiable evidence storage for forensic audit trails.
- **Polkadot (REVM):** High-performance coordination and real-time governance guards.

# Cognivern: AI Governance Platform for Decentralized Agents

A production-ready governance platform for autonomous AI agents operating across **Sapience** (prediction markets), **Recall** (decentralized memory), and **Filecoin** (storage & governance). Built for the [Sapience Hackathon](https://www.sapience.xyz/hackathon).

## 🌟 Overview

Cognivern is a multi-chain AI governance platform that enables autonomous agents to:
1. **Forecast & Trade** - Participate in Sapience prediction markets with EAS attestations on Arbitrum.
2. **Horizon-Weighted Intelligence** - Optimized strategy to maximize Brier Score by predicting accurately early.
3. **Store Knowledge** - Persist reasoning and memory on Recall Network.
4. **Resilient Brains** - Multi-LLM fallback (Routeway.ai + Groq) to ensure 100% uptime.

## 🎯 Sapience Hackathon Integration

### Forecasting Agent Track (LIVE)
- ✅ **Horizon-Weighted Strategy** - Prioritizes markets with the longest resolution window for maximum points.
- ✅ **Resilient Forecasting** - Primary: Routeway.ai (Kimi K2) | Fallback: Groq (Llama 3.3).
- ✅ **Direct GraphQL Integration** - Custom fail-safe fetching logic for Sapience market data.
- ✅ **EAS Attestations** - Real-time forecast submissions recorded on Arbitrum One.
- ✅ **On-Chain Persistence** - Reasoning and thoughts stored permanently on Recall Network.

### Key Features
- **📊 Live "Thoughts" Dashboard** - Real-time display of agent reasoning and decision-making process.
- **🏆 Strategic Accuracy** - Mathematically optimized to win the "Accuracy" track via early predictions.
- **🔗 Multi-Chain Architecture** - Unified logic across Arbitrum (Execution), Recall (Memory), and Filecoin (Governance).
- **🛡️ Governance Native** - Policy enforcement layer built-in to prevent high-risk actions.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Production Setup)

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v20.14+
- pnpm
- Arbitrum ETH for gas fees (Address: `0xc8F0D4FF31166Daf37804C20eeFd059e041E64dC`)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thisyearnofear/cognivern.git
cd cognivern
pnpm install
```

### Configuration

Cognivern enforces a strict **"No Mocks"** policy. Features only activate when valid production keys are present.

Create `.env` file:

```env
# Sapience / Arbitrum (REQUIRED)
ARBITRUM_RPC_URL=https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc
SAPIENCE_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here

# Resilient LLM Layer (REQUIRED)
ROUTEWAY_API_KEY=your_routeway_key
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_key

# Recall Network (REQUIRED for Memory)
RECALL_API_KEY=your_recall_key
RECALL_BUCKET=agent-memory

# Filecoin FVM (REQUIRED for Governance)
FILECOIN_RPC_URL=https://api.calibration.node.glif.io/rpc/v1
FILECOIN_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
GOVERNANCE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x...
```

### Running the Live Agent

**Start the Unified Service (API + Forecasting Brain):**
```bash
pnpm build
pm2 start dist/index.js --name cognivern-agent
```

## 🏗️ Architecture: The Resilient Brain

Cognivern implements a **Multi-LLM Fallback Layer** to ensure no market opportunity is missed:
1. **Tier 1 (Routeway.ai):** High-context reasoning using Moonshot Kimi K2.
2. **Tier 2 (Groq):** Ultra-fast failover using Llama 3.3 (70B) if Routeway is throttled or offline.

This resilience combined with our **Horizon-Weighted Strategy** ensures the agent is consistently making high-value predictions on Arbitrum.

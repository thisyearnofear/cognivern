# AI Agent Governance Platform

A decentralized platform for auditing, monitoring, and governing AI agents through trusted, verifiable intelligence using Recall's blockchain-based storage infrastructure.

## 🌟 Overview

The AI Agent Governance Platform provides a comprehensive solution for ensuring transparency, accountability, and collaboration between AI agents. By leveraging Recall's decentralized intelligence layer, this platform enables:

- **Verifiable Decision Logs:** Full audit trails for AI agent reasoning and actions
- **Intelligence Marketplace:** Exchange of valuable reasoning patterns between agents
- **Governance Protocols:** Rules-based oversight of agent behavior and performance
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration:** Secure, trustless cooperation between independent agents

This platform helps organizations maintain control and visibility over their AI systems while unlocking new possibilities for agent cooperation and knowledge exchange.

- Recall account with available credits
- Private key with sufficient permissions

### Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```bash
# Recall Configuration
RECALL_PRIVATE_KEY="your-private-key"
RECALL_BUCKET_ALIAS="governance-platform"
RECALL_NETWORK="testnet"

# Sync Configuration
RECALL_SYNC_INTERVAL="60000"
RECALL_BATCH_SIZE="8"

# Provider Configuration

```

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/thisyearnofear/ai-agent-governance.git
cd ai-agent-governance

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build the project
pnpm build

# Start the platform
pnpm start
```

## 📊 Usage Examples

### Monitor an Agent

```typescript
import { GovernanceMonitor } from 'ai-agent-governance';

const monitor = new GovernanceMonitor({
  agentId: 'financial-advisor-1',
  policyName: 'financial-advisory',
  recallBucket: 'governance-platform',
});

monitor.attach(myExistingAgent);
await monitor.startMonitoring();
```

### List a Pattern in the Marketplace

```typescript
import { MarketplaceService } from 'ai-agent-governance';

const marketplace = new MarketplaceService();
await marketplace.initialize();

const pattern = {
  id: 'pattern-123',
  title: 'Financial Analysis Pattern',
  description: 'A pattern for analyzing financial data',
  pattern: '// Financial analysis logic here',
  price: 99.99,
  currency: 'USD',
  authorId: 'author-1',
  createdAt: new Date(),
  updatedAt: new Date(),
  metadata: {
    category: 'finance',
    tags: ['analysis', 'data'],
    version: '1.0.0',
    rating: 4.5,
    downloads: 0,
  },
};

await marketplace.listPattern(pattern);
```

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- All sensitive data is encrypted before storage in Recall buckets
- Private keys should be secured using appropriate secret management practices
